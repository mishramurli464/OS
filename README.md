# OS
Operating System lies in the category of system software. It basically manages all the resources of the computer. An Operating System can be defined as an interface between user and hardware.  
It is responsible for the execution of all the processes, Resource Allocation, CPU management, File Management and many other tasks.

## Program  
Program is a static, or passive, entity stored in the disk. It is a file containing binary form of instructions.  
A program could store high-level programming language directly if that language is compiled at run time. Such program is called interpreted program.  

For example, we developers write code in high-level programming language such as C. Computer cannot read C directly so a compiler is in place to translate C into executable file, an exefile.  
This executable file is the Program. On the other hand, JavaScript and Python are interpreted program so we don’t have to compile it first.   

## Process 
Process is like an instance of a Program. When a program is loaded onto memory, it becomes Process and is now considered an active entity.  
Process requires more resources comparing to Program because when it is running, it needs memory and CPU to do the fetching and calculation.  
A program might associated with multiple process, and a process might includes multiple threads.  

## Thread
A thread is the basic unit of executable code in a process. It comes with its own set of registers and stack.  
A single-thread process means that a process could only perform a task one at a time. There is also multi-threads process, meaning it could run multiple tasks at a time.  
Of course multi-threads are more efficient, but it also brings some side effects that single thread wouldn’t encounter, such as deadlock and concurrency.
